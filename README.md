# Elevator Challenge Products
* This is a technical test site built to showcase my React capabilities. 
* It's made up of 5 pages, 
    - Home page
    - Product List page
    - Product Detail page
    - Cart page
    - Not Found page
* At time of writing this, there are 2 major bugs still prevalent in the system namely:
    - Product Detail page bookmarking/url navigation
    - Show more truncation thresholds
